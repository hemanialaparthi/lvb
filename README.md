# Linear vs Binary Search Tree

## Overview

This project benchmarks the performance of various search algorithms, including linear search, binary search (iterative and recursive), and binary search tree (BST) search. It allows users to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms on different data structures and datasets.

## Features

- Generate datasets of integers, floats, or strings.
- Support for unsorted lists, sorted lists, and binary search trees.
- Benchmark search algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)
  - Binary Search Tree Search
- Configurable dataset size, number of runs, and target selection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies:
  - `typer` for command-line interface
  - `rich` for rich text output
  - `ruff` for linting (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd lvb
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
